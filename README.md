**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**

Following the basic structure of a user story such as a goal or reason can help reach the user's needs and implement it seemly in a project or program. Also having feedback from the user during the development process can also help. As it can help refine the product and help meet their expectations on the final product.

**How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**

The best way to approach is to understand the problem and the clear goal. This can be accomplished by collaborating with the customer or stakeholders. Breaking down the work into chunks by using user stories and then organizing them into a backlog can help prioritize the most important features. Doing this can help focus on the more important tasks first.
